# bootstrap

`bootstrap` is the home for all configs I use for various states of development; including my workstation setup

We've got mostly Ansible in here so far with a bit of bash but I'm still in the process of porting over other setup-related items.

At the moment, we only have 1 Ansible playbook in here that works with macOS Mojave (10.14.6).  Please see the comments in the `play_dev_setup.yml` for more information.
